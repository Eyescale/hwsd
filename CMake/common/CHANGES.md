### 2014.6

* Flatten git externals in release branches
    Needed for some build services which do not allow to pull in git
    externals at runtime.
* Decouple RELEASE_VERSION from VERSION_ABI. The first is detected
    automatically when build from a release branch or non-git source
    folder. The latter now has to be set explicitely in the top-level
    CMakeLists.
* Add COMMON_USE_CXX03 to disable c++11 features for incompatible
    projects.
* Unify active ubuntu codenames in Ubuntu.cmake
* Denoised output of find_package() generated by PackageConfig
* Match lcov colors to BBP quality metrics
